# Introduction

Mudpuppy is a terminal [MUD] client with a customizable interface and Python
scripting.

This _work-in-progress_ user manual aims to help you understand and use
Mudpuppy. While Mudpuppy is a prototype, you may ask questions in [our Discord
server] provided you understand the project is deeply in-flux.
